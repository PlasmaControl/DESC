One important point to consider during profiling is to use `block_until_ready()` as explained [here](https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/async_dispatch.html). If you want to specifically use `numpy` version, instead of using `numpy` backend for the whole code, just import `numpy` as usual. There are couple places in the code, we specifically use `numpy` functions. There are different reasons for these, for example, since `jax.array`s are immutable, sometimes they behave unexpectedly in loops, or sometimes `jax.numpy` functions have overhead that makes them slower compared to their `numpy` counterpart for single use."

For the functions you will call many times, the aim is to reduce to number of recompilations. For instance, \n",

    "will be compiled for every single value of `dx`. Another reason for recompilation can be the argument `x`. The primary reason for most recompilations is the change of array shapes, i.e. `x=jnp.arange(5)` and `jnp.arange(10)` will use a different compiled code. Similarly, `x=jnp.float64(5.0)` and `x=jnp.int64(5)` will also need 2 different compiled code. These type of recompilations are trickier to detect because of the concept of weak/strong types. In a nutshell, one needs to use the same data type to prevent recompilation. For example, `float(3.14)` and `jnp.float64(3.14)` are different in terms of JAX's cache checking. Due to this, in some parts of the code, we have nested calls like `jnp.float64(float(x))`. The first `float(x)` is to make sure that `x` is a scalar value, and the second one is to cast it to a final type.\n",
