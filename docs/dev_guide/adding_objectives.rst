Adding new objective functions
==============================

.. attention::
    This page is mainly intended to explain some of the logic inside of objective functions.
    For simple objectives like shown in this page, it is recommended to use the `GenericObjective <https://desc-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_api/objectives/desc.objectives.GenericObjective.html#desc.objectives.GenericObjective>`__
    (for objectives that simply just use values computable already in the data index, see
    `List of Variables <https://desc-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/variables.html>`__)
    or `ObjectiveFromUser <https://desc-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_api/objectives/desc.objectives.ObjectiveFromUser.html#desc-objectives-objectivefromuser>`__
    (for quantities which are derived from things computable from the data index)
    classes. The benefit of making a full objective class like shown in this page is mainly when dealing
    with multiple objects at once (see e.g `PlasmaVesselDistance <https://desc-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_api/objectives/desc.objectives.PlasmaVesselDistance.html#desc.objectives.PlasmaVesselDistance>`__),
    or more complicated objectives (like `EffectiveRipple <https://desc-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_api/objectives/desc.objectives.EffectiveRipple.html#desc.objectives.EffectiveRipple>`__)
    or having better control over default values and overriding some methods such as ``print_value``.
    Most objectives can trivially be made with ``GenericObjective`` and ``ObjectiveFromUser``:
    ::

        from desc.objectives import ObjectiveFromUser, GenericObjective
        from desc.equilibrium import Equilibrium
        from desc.integrals import surface_min, surface_max

        eq = Equilibrium()

        # QS triple product, already exists as "f_T" in the data index
        obj_QS_triple = GenericObjective(f="f_T", thing=eq)

        # Mirror ratio, manually computed from "|B|"
        def fun_mirror_ratio(grid, data):
            max_tz_B = surface_max(grid=grid, x=data["|B|"], surface_label="rho")
            min_tz_B = surface_min(grid=grid, x=data["|B|"], surface_label="rho")

            max_tz_B = grid.compress(max_tz_B, surface_label="rho")
            min_tz_B = grid.compress(min_tz_B, surface_label="rho")

            mirror_ratio = (max_tz_B - min_tz_B) / (min_tz_B + max_tz_B)

            return mirror_ratio
            # alternatively, "mirror ratio" is something that can be computed in the data index
            # directly (see List of Variables docs), so can replace entirety of the above function code with this return statement
            # return grid.compress(data["mirror ratio"])
            # or can just use GenericObjective(f="mirror ratio", thing=eq) like given above
        obj_mirror_ratio = ObjectiveFromUser(fun=fun_mirror_ratio, thing=eq)

This guide walks through creating a new objective to optimize using Quasi-symmetry and mirror ratio as
an example. The primary methods needed for a new objective are ``__init__``, ``build``,
and ``compute``. The base class ``_Objective`` provides a number of other methods that
generally do not need to be re-implemented for subclasses such as derivative calculation,
deviation from the target value, scaled cost and many common attributes.

``__init__`` should generally just assign attributes and store inputs. The object(s) that will be optimized by
the objective is (are) also defined in the ``__init__`` method. This (these) can be any object that is inherited from
``Optimizable`` super-class, i.e. ``Equilibrium``, ``Coil``, ``Surface``. ``__init__`` method should not do
any expensive calculations, these should be in ``build`` or ``compute``. The main
arguments are summarized in the example below.

``build`` is called before optimization either by user or automatically. It is used to
precompute things that will be constant during the optimization like transform matrices that convert spectral
coefficients to real space values, the values of the fixed plasma profiles, names of the physics quantities
required that are registered as compute functions, shape of the objective value etc.
The quantities that will be used by ``compute`` are then packaged into ``constants``. ``build`` method
also performs any necessary checks on the inputs before starting the optimization.

``compute`` is where the actual calculation of the objective takes place. Objectives
generally return a vector of residuals that are minimized in a least squares sense,
though the exact method will depend on the optimization algorithm. The main thing here
is calling ``compute_fun`` to get physics quantities, and then performing any
post-processing we want such as averaging, combining, etc. ``compute`` must always return
a 1-D array.

Now let's look at ``QuasisymmetryTripleProduct`` as an example. This objective takes in an ``Equilibrium``
object and computes the quasi-symmetry triple product.

First, we need some common imports that almost all objectives in DESC need. One thing to keep in mind here is that ``desc.compute.utils``
offers 2 functions namely ``compute`` and ``_compute``. The latter is the JIT compatible version of the former, and is used
in the ``compute`` method of the objective. The former has additional checks that make it incompatible to use in JIT-compiled
functions. We import ``_compute`` with an alias ``compute_fun`` to avoid confusion with the ``compute`` method of the objective.
::

    from desc.objectives.objective_funs import _Objective
    from desc.objectives.normalization import compute_scaling_factors
    from desc.compute import get_profiles, get_transforms
    from desc.compute.utils import _compute as compute_fun
    from desc.grid import LinearGrid


``_Objective`` parent class provides a lot of functionality for objectives, such as ``compute_scaled`` for scaling the result of
``compute`` method, ``compute_scaled_error`` for computing the error from the target, ``jac_scaled_error`` for computing the
Jacobian of the scaled error, and many other methods. The docstring of the objective should explain special inputs. The docstrings
for common inputs (i.e. ``target``, ``bounds``, ``weight``, ``jac_chunk_size`` etc)  can be inherited from the base class
and can be adjusted as shown below.
::

    class QuasisymmetryTripleProduct(_Objective):  # need to subclass from ``desc.objectives._Objective``
        """Give a description of what it is and what it's useful for.

            Collocation grid containing the nodes to evaluate at.

        """
        # Most of the documentation is shared among all objectives, so we just inherit
        # the docstring from the base class and add a few details specific to this objective.
        # See the documentation of `collect_docs` for more details.
        __doc__ = __doc__.rstrip() + collect_docs(
            target_default="``target=0``.", bounds_default="``target=0``."
        )

        _coordinates = "rtz"    # What coordinates is this objective a function of, with r=rho, t=theta, z=zeta?
                                # i.e. if only a profile, it is "r" , while if all 3 coordinates it is "rtz"
        _units = "(T^4/m^2)"    # units of the output
        _print_value_fmt = "Quasi-symmetry error: "    # string with the name of the printed value, used when showing results of an optimization
        _static_attrs = _Objective._static_attrs + [] # list of strings of attribute names that should be considered static by jax, eg strings and booleans or anything used for control flow.

``__init__`` method should assign the optimizable thing(s) to the ``things`` attribute, which is a list of objects
that will be optimized. For this example, we will optimize an ``Equilibrium`` object, so we assign it to the
``things`` as a list. As explained before, the ``__init__`` method should not do any expensive calculations, so we just assign the
attributes and call the parent class's ``__init__`` method which will handle common inputs and finalize the initialization.
::

        def __init__(
            self,
            eq,
            target=None,
            bounds=None,
            weight=1,

        ):

            if target is None and bounds is None:
                target = 0 # default target value
            self._grid = grid
            super().__init__(
                things=[eq], # things is a list of things that will be optimized, in this case just the equilibrium
                target=target,
                bounds=bounds,
                weight=weight,
                normalize=normalize,
                normalize_target=normalize_target,
                name=name,
                jac_chunk_size=jac_chunk_size
            )

``build`` method can be thought as a pre-computation step that prepares the objective for optimization by storing the constants
needed for ``compute`` method to prevent extra computations. This method is not JIT-compiled, so it can perform any Python code.

``grid`` is a ``Grid`` object that contains the nodes where the objective will be evaluated. If it is not provided, a default
grid is created based on the grid requirements for the objective. For example, if the objective needs to compute a volumetric
quantity, a grid that covers the entire plasma volume needs to be chosen as default, or if there is an integral quantity
a grid with proper quadrature points needs to be chosen. Sometimes 2 grids are needed, for example coil objectives, one for the
evaluation points on plasma surface and one for the coil segments for Biot-Savart integration.

Probably the most important part of the ``build`` method is to call ``get_profiles`` and ``get_transforms`` functions
from ``desc.compute.utils``. These functions return the profiles and transforms needed to compute the physics
quantities from the equilibrium object. Both functions return dictionaries. Since these require information on the
computation grid, one needs to call them after assigning the grid to the objective.

``_data_keys`` is a list of strings that specifies which physics quantities are needed
to be computed, for this example, from the equilibrium object. If there are multiple things in ``self.things``, one
can create separate lists for each thing. One can use a different name instead of ``_data_keys``, but it is a convention
in most DESC objectives. ``_dim_f`` is the size of the output vector returned by ``compute`` method.
This quantity is used in ``ObjectiveFunction`` class to conduct concatenation or splitting and the name
``_dim_f`` has to be kept to prevent errors. One should also define the proper normalization factor for
the objective, if needed. The units of the normalization factor should be such that the objective value is unitless.

We put all the constants into a dictionary called ``self._constants``. This dictionary will be passed to the
``compute`` method as the ``constants`` argument, so it can access the transforms and profiles needed to compute the objective.
Alternatively, one can also store the constants as attributes of the objective, for instance ``self._transforms``
and ``self._profiles``. Finally, we call the parent class's ``build`` method for common parts of building the objective.

The actual computation of the objective happens in ``compute`` method. This method is JIT-compiled
(unless ``use_jit=False`` is passed to ``build`` method), so it should only contain JIT-compatible code.
This method takes in the parameters of the thing(s) to be optimized, which is the dictionary form of the
state vector such as `R_lmn`, `Z_lmn`, etc. for the ``Equilibrium`` object. Objectives with multiple ``things``
can have multiple parameters, one for each thing in ``self.things``, in this case, the function signature would be
``compute(self, params_1, params_2, params3, ..., constants=None)``, see the
`PlasmaVesselDistance <https://desc-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_api/objectives/desc.objectives.PlasmaVesselDistance.html#desc.objectives.PlasmaVesselDistance>`__
objective for an example of this. The ``constants`` argument is a dictionary of any other constant and usually set to ``None``
so that the ``self.constants`` are used.

Converting to Cartesian coordinates
-----------------------------------

The above examples of quasi-symmetry and mirror ratio are quantities that are independent of the
coordinate system. ``desc.compute.utils._compute`` always returns all vector quantities
in toroidal coordinates :math:`(R,\phi,Z)`. If you would prefer to work in Cartesian
coordinates :math:`(X,Y,Z)` for any intermediate computations within your new objective,
you will have to manually convert these vectors using the geometry utility functions
``rpz2xyz`` and/or ``rpz2xyz_vec``. See the ``PlasmaVesselDistance`` objective for an
example of this.

Adapting Existing Objectives with Different Loss Functions
----------------------------------------------------------

If your desired objective is already implemented in DESC, but not in the correct form,
a few different loss functions are available through the ``loss_function`` kwarg
when instantiating an Objective, to modify the objective cost in order to adapt
the objective to your desired purpose. For example, the DESC ``RotationalTransform``
objective with ``target=iota_target`` by default forms the residual by taking the target
and subtracting it from the profile at the points in the grid, resulting in a residual
of the form :math:`\iota_{err} = \sum_{i} (\iota_i - iota_{target})^2`, i.e. the residual
is the sum of squared pointwise error between the current rotational transform profile
and the target passed into the objective. If the desired objective instead is to
optimize to target an average rotational transform of `iota_target`, we can adapt the
``RotationalTransform`` object by passing in ``loss_function="mean"``. The options
available for the ``loss_function`` kwarg are ``[None,"mean","min","max"]``, with
``None`` meaning using the usual default objective cost, while ``"mean"`` takes the
average of the raw objective values (before subtracting the target/bounds or
normalization), ``"min"`` takes the minimum, and ``"max"`` takes the maximum.
