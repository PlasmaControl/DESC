**Warning:**

These objectives depend on other codes external to DESC. They are not routinely tested
and may not be compatible with all versions of the codes. The DESC team is not
responsible for maintaining or documenting those external codes, and we do not guarantee
to regularly maintain these objectives. Use these at your own risk!

The external codes are not included with DESC, and you may need to obtain access to them
to use these objectives. Those codes may not be publicly available and may require a
license to install them.
