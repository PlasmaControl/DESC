    "It is still a good practice to test both versions to see which one is faster (for functions outside of jit). One important point to consider during profiling is to use `block_until_ready()` as explained [here](https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/async_dispatch.html). If you want to specifically use `numpy` version, instead of using `numpy` backend for the whole code, just import `numpy` as usual. There are couple places in the code, we specifically use `numpy` functions. There are different reasons for these, for example, since `jax.array`s are immutable, sometimes they behave unexpectedly in loops, or sometimes `jax.numpy` functions have overhead that makes them slower compared to their `numpy` counterpart for single use."

Depending on the backend, DESC automatically chooses which method of differentiation to use. If there is no `JAX` installation, it uses finite difference for derivatives. "
