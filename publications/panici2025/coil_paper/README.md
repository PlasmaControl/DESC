After installing DESC ``v0.14.2``, then install kaleido ``pip install kaleido`` (so that 3D plots may be saved),
running ``plot_figures.ipynb`` will create all plots from the paper except for those describing the torus knot topology.

Those may be created by checking out git commit ``6c7f72b48c639bf500dff4e2246cb1413e31781f`` (after installing DESC from source, see https://desc-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html) and then running the notebook ``plot_knots.ipynb``
