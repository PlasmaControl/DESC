This folder contains the files necessary to reproduce the results in the paper
"Magnetic Fields with General Omnigenity" by Dudt et al.
A copy of this paper will be included as `dudt2023omnigenity.pdf`.

The included files are as follows:

- `name.py` is a Python script that runs the optimization in DESC.
- `name.h5` is the DESC HDF5 output file of the Equilibrium class representing the solution.
- `wout_name.nc` is the VMEC NetCDF output file representing the solution.
- `in_booz.name` is the BOOZ_XFORM input file (required for running NEO).
- `neo_in.name` is the NEO input file.
- `neo_out.name` is the NEO output file.
- `plotter.py` is a Python script that generates the figures in the paper.

`name` in the above filenames correspond to the following six examples:

- `poloidal` M=0, N=2 omnigentiy
- `poloidal_qs` M=0, N=1 quasi-symmetry
- `helical` M=1, N=5 omnigentiy
- `helical_qs` M=1, N=5 quasi-symmetry
- `toroidal` M=1, N=0 omnigentiy
- `toroidal_qs` M=1, N=0 quasi-symmetry

In order to run the driver scripts `name.py`, checkout commit `7c099c54e964e86086d3d9521adcc1a133ffdc8c`.
The latest figures were generated by running `plotter.py` on commit `45c2c11dfb1f4a62503cc13dd62b9e198665c05a`.
