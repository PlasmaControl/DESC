Adding new objective functions
------------------------------

This guide walks through creating a new objective to optimize using Quasi-symmetry as
an example. The primary methods needed for a new objective are ``__init__``, ``build``,
and ``compute``. The base class ``_Objective`` provides a number of other methods that
generally do not need to be re-implemented for subclasses.

``__init__`` should generally just assign attributes and store inputs. It should not do
any expensive calculations, these should be in ``build`` or ``compute``. The main arguments
are summarized in the example below.

``build`` is called before optimization with the ``Equilibrium`` to be optimized.
It is used to precompute things like transform matrices that convert between spectral
coefficients and real space values.
In the build method, we first ensure that a ``Grid`` is assigned, using default values
from the equilibrium if necessary. The grid defines the points in flux coordinates where
we evaluate the residuals.
Next, we define the physics quantities we need to evaluate the objective (``_data_keys``),
and the number of residuals that will be returned by ``compute`` (``_dim_f``).
Next, we use some helper functions to build the required ``Transform`` and ``Profile``
objects needed to compute the desired physics quantities. These ``transforms`` and
``profiles`` are then packaged into ``constants``, which will be passed to the ``compute``
method. Other "constant" values that are needed to compute the given quantity such as
hyperparameters or other objects that will not be optimized should also be included in
``constants``.
Finally, we call the base class ``build`` method to do some checking of array sizes and
other misc. stuff.

``compute`` is where the actual calculation of the residual takes place. Objectives
generally return a vector of residuals that are minimized in a least squares sense, though
the exact method will depend on the optimization algorithm. The main thing here is
calling ``compute_fun`` to get physics quantities, and then performing any post-processing
we want such as averaging, combining, etc.

        Parameters
        ----------
        eq : Equilibrium
            Equilibrium that will be optimized to satisfy the Objective.
        target : {float, ndarray}, optional
            Target value(s) of the objective. Only used if bounds is None.
            Must be broadcastable to Objective.dim_f.
        bounds : tuple of {float, ndarray}, optional
            Lower and upper bounds on the objective. Overrides target.
            Both bounds must be broadcastable to to Objective.dim_f
        weight : {float, ndarray}, optional
            Weighting to apply to the Objective, relative to other Objectives.
            Must be broadcastable to to Objective.dim_f

            Whether to compute the error in physical units or non-dimensionalize.
        normalize_target : bool, optional
            Whether target and bounds should be normalized before comparing to computed
            values. If `normalize` is `True` and the target is in physical units,
            this should also be set to True.

            Loss function to apply to the objective values once computed. This loss function
            is called on the raw compute value, before any shifting, scaling, or
            normalization.

Adapting Existing Objectives with Different Loss Funtions
---------------------------------------------------------

If your desired objective is already implemented in DESC, but not in the correct form, a few different
loss functions are available through the the `loss_function` kwarg when instantiating an Objective objective to
modify the objective cost in order to adapt the objective to your desired purpose.
For example, the DESC `RotationalTransform` objective with `target=iota_target` by default forms the residual
by taking the target and subtracting it from the profile at the points in the grid, resulting in a residual of
the form $\iota_{err} = \sum_{i} (\iota_i-iota_target)^2$, i.e. the residual is the sum of squared pointwise error
between the current rotational transform profile and the target passed into the objective.
If the desired objective instead is to optimize to target an average rotational transform of `iota_target`, we can adapt
the `RotationalTransform` object by passing in `loss_function="mean"`.
The options available for the `loss_function` kwarg are `[None,"mean","min","max"]`, with `None` meaning using the usual
default objective cost, while `"mean"` takes the average of the raw objective values (before subtracting the target/bounds or normalization),
`"min"` takes the minimum, and `"max"` takes the maximum.
