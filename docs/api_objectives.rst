Objectives, Optimizers, and Grids

Objectives and Constraints
**************************
``desc.objectives`` defines a number of different metrics for stellarator optimization
problems, which can be used as either objectives or constraints depending on how they
are passed to the optimizer. Individual objectives are combined into an ``ObjectiveFunction``
that is then passed to the ``Optimizer``.

Optimization
************
``desc.optimize.Optimizer`` is the primary interface, it contains wrappers for a number
of different methods listed in `Optimizers Supported <https://desc-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/optimizers.html>`_.

.. autosummary::
   :toctree: _api/optimize
   :recursive:
   :template: class.rst

   desc.optimize.Optimizer

There are also a number of optimizers written specifically for DESC that we also offer
with a direct interface similar to ``scipy.optimize.minimize``:

.. autosummary::
   :toctree: _api/optimize
   :recursive:
   :template: class.rst

   desc.optimize.lsqtr
   desc.optimize.fmintr
   desc.optimize.fmin_auglag
   desc.optimize.lsq_auglag
   desc.optimize.sgd

DESC also allows you to use custom optimizers by creating a wrapper function and
registering it using ``desc.optimize.register_optimizer``. See `Adding optimizers <https://desc-docs.readthedocs.io/en/stable/adding_optimizers.html>`_
for details

.. autosummary::
   :toctree: _api/optimize
   :recursive:
   :template: class.rst

   desc.optimize.register_optimizer


Grids
*****
A grid defines a set of collocation nodes in computational coordinates where physics
quantities are to be evaluated. DESC offers a number of options with different patterns
and spacing. Each objective generally has a default grid that works for most cases, but
often it is desired to specify where particular objectives should be targeted, such as
targeting quasi-symmetry on particular surfaces. For this a user defined grid can be
created and passed to the corresponding objective.

.. autosummary::
    :toctree: _api/grid/
    :recursive:
    :template: class.rst

    desc.grid.Grid
    desc.grid.LinearGrid
    desc.grid.QuadratureGrid
    desc.grid.ConcentricGrid

``desc.grid`` also contains utilities for finding the most and least rational surfaces
for a given iota profile, for either avoiding or analyzing rational surfaces.

.. autosummary::
    :toctree: _api/grid/
    :recursive:
    :template: class.rst

    desc.grid.find_least_rational_surfaces
    desc.grid.find_most_rational_surfaces
