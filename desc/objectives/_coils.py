    Parameters
    ----------
    coil : CoilSet or Coil
        Coil for which the data keys will be optimized.
    data_keys : list of str
        data keys that will be optimized when this class is inherited.
    target : float, ndarray, optional
        Target value(s) of the objective. Only used if bounds is None.
        Must be broadcastable to Objective.dim_f.
    bounds : tuple of float, ndarray, optional
        Lower and upper bounds on the objective. Overrides target.
        Both bounds must be broadcastable to to Objective.dim_f
    weight : float, ndarray, optional
        Weighting to apply to the Objective, relative to other Objectives.
        Must be broadcastable to to Objective.dim_f
    normalize : bool, optional
        Whether to compute the error in physical units or non-dimensionalize.
    normalize_target : bool, optional
        Whether target and bounds should be normalized before comparing to computed
        values. If `normalize` is `True` and the target is in physical units,
        this should also be set to True.
        be set to True.
    loss_function : {None, 'mean', 'min', 'max'}, optional
        Loss function to apply to the objective values once computed. This loss function
        is called on the raw compute value, before any shifting, scaling, or
        normalization. Operates over all coils, not each individual coil.
    deriv_mode : {"auto", "fwd", "rev"}
        Specify how to compute jacobian matrix, either forward mode or reverse mode AD.
        "auto" selects forward or reverse mode based on the size of the input and output

        reverse mode and forward over reverse mode respectively.
    grid : Grid, list, optional
        Collocation grid containing the nodes to evaluate at.
        If a list, must have the same structure as coil.

    Uses virtual casing to find plasma component of B and penalizes

    Parameters
    ----------
    eq : Equilibrium
        Equilibrium upon whose surface the normal field error will be minimized.
        The equilibrium is kept fixed during the optimization with this objective.
    field : MagneticField

        minimize the normal field error on the provided equilibrium's surface.
    target : float, ndarray, optional
        Target value(s) of the objective. Only used if bounds is None.
        len(target) must be equal to Objective.dim_f.
        Default target is zero.
    bounds : tuple, optional
        Lower and upper bounds on the objective. Overrides target.

        len(weight) must be equal to Objective.dim_f

        Whether to compute the error in physical units or non-dimensionalize.
    normalize_target : bool
        Whether target and bounds should be normalized before comparing to computed
        values. If `normalize` is `True` and the target is in physical units,
        this should also be set to True.
    source_grid : Grid, optional

        Default grid is detailed in the docs for ``compute_B_plasma``
    eval_grid : Grid, optional
        Collocation grid containing the nodes on the plasma surface at which the
        magnetic field is being calculated and where to evaluate Bn errors.

        NFP=int(eq.NFP), sym=False)``
    field_grid : Grid, optional
        Grid used to discretize field (e.g. grid for the magnetic field source from
        coils). Default grid is determined by the specific MagneticField object, see
        the docs of that object's ``compute_magnetic_field`` method for more detail.
    vacuum : bool
        If true, B_plasma (the contribution to the normal field on the boundary from the
        plasma currents) is set to zero.

    This objective is needed when performing stage-two coil optimization on
    a vacuum equilibrium, to avoid the trivial solution of minimizing Bn
    by making the coil currents zero. Instead, this objective ensures
    the coils create the necessary toroidal flux for the equilibrium field.

    Parameters
    ----------
    eq : Equilibrium
        Equilibrium for which the toroidal flux will be calculated.
        The Equilibrium is assumed to be held fixed when using this
        objective.
    field : MagneticField
        MagneticField object, the parameters of this will be optimized
        to minimize the objective.
    target : {float, ndarray}, optional
        Target value(s) of the objective. Only used if bounds is None.
        Defaults to eq.Psi. Must be broadcastable to Objective.dim_f.
    bounds : tuple of {float, ndarray}, optional
        Lower and upper bounds on the objective. Overrides target.
        Both bounds must be broadcastable to to Objective.dim_f
    weight : {float, ndarray}, optional
        Weighting to apply to the Objective, relative to other Objectives.
        Must be broadcastable to to Objective.dim_f
    normalize : bool, optional
        Whether to compute the error in physical units or non-dimensionalize.
    normalize_target : bool
        Whether target should be normalized before comparing to computed values.
        if `normalize` is `True` and the target is in physical units, this should also
        be set to True.
    loss_function : {None, 'mean', 'min', 'max'}, optional
        Loss function to apply to the objective values once computed. This function
        is called on the raw compute value, before any shifting, scaling, or
        normalization. Note: has no effect for this objective
    deriv_mode : {"auto", "fwd", "rev"}
        Specify how to compute jacobian matrix, either forward mode or reverse mode AD.
        "auto" selects forward or reverse mode based on the size of the input and output
        of the objective. Has no effect on self.grad or self.hess which always use
        reverse mode and forward over reverse mode respectively.
    field_grid : Grid, optional
        Grid containing the nodes to evaluate field source at on
        the winding surface. (used if e.g. field is a CoilSet or
        FourierCurrentPotentialField). Defaults to the default for the
        given field, see the docstring of the field object for the specific default.
    eval_grid : Grid, optional
        Collocation grid containing the nodes to evaluate the normal magnetic field at
        plasma geometry at. Defaults to a LinearGrid(L=eq.L_grid, M=eq.M_grid,
        zeta=jnp.array(0.0), NFP=eq.NFP).
