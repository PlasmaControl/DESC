This folder contains input files and a Jupyter notebook to reproduce the plots from the
paper "Stellarator Optimization with Constraints."

The input ``.py`` scripts can be used to generate the corresponding ``.h5`` and ``.pkl``
output files each of the three configurations. The jupyter notebook can then be run to
load the results and generate the plots.
