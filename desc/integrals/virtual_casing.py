        Dictionary of data at source points (corresponding to source_grid). Keys
        should be those required by kernel as kernel.keys. Vector data should be in

    source_grid : _Grid
        Grid in (r,t,z) coordinates containing the flux surface over which
        the kernel should be integrated.
    kernel : callable
        Kernel function to evaluate and integrate over the surface described by source_grid.
    chunk_size : int or None
        Size to split computation into chunks.
        If no chunking should be done or the chunk size is the full input

        The surface integral is computed on the full domain because the kernels of
        interest have toroidal variation and are not NFP periodic. To that end, the
        integral is computed on every field period and summed. The ``source_grid`` is
        the first field period because DESC truncates the computational domain to
        ζ ∈ [0, 2π/grid.NFP) and changes variables to the spectrally condensed
        ζ* = basis.NFP ζ. Therefore, we shift the domain to the next field period by
        incrementing the toroidal coordinate of the grid by 2π/NFP. For an axisymmetric
        configuration, it is most efficient for ``source_grid`` to be a single toroidal
        cross-section. To capture toroidal effects of the kernels on those grids for
        axisymmetric configurations, we set a dummy value for NFP to an integer larger
        than 1 so that the toroidal increment can move to a new spot.
