    The bounce integral is defined as ‚à´ f(œÅ,Œ±,Œª,‚Ñì) d‚Ñì where

    * d‚Ñì parameterizes the distance along the field line in meters.
    * f(œÅ,Œ±,Œª,‚Ñì) is the quantity to integrate along the field line.
    * The boundaries of the integral are bounce points ‚Ñì‚ÇÅ, ‚Ñì‚ÇÇ s.t. Œª|B|(œÅ,Œ±,‚Ñì·µ¢) = 1.
    * Œª is a constant defining the integral proportional to the magnetic moment
      over energy.
    * |B| is the norm of the magnetic field.

    For a particle with fixed Œª, bounce points are defined to be the location on the
    field line such that the particle's velocity parallel to the magnetic field is zero.
    The bounce integral is defined up to a sign. We choose the sign that corresponds to
    the particle's guiding center trajectory traveling in the direction of increasing
    field-line-following coordinate Œ∂.

    Overview
    --------
    Magnetic field line with label Œ±, defined by B = ‚àáœà √ó ‚àáŒ±, is determined from
      Œ± : œÅ, Œ∏, Œ∂ ‚Ü¶ Œ∏ + Œª(œÅ,Œ∏,Œ∂) ‚àí Œπ(œÅ) [Œ∂ + œâ(œÅ,Œ∏,Œ∂)]
    Interpolate Fourier-Chebyshev series to DESC poloidal coordinate.
      Œ∏ : œÅ, Œ±, Œ∂ ‚Ü¶ t‚Çò‚Çô(œÅ) exp(jmŒ±) T‚Çô(Œ∂)
    Compute bounce points.
      r(Œ∂‚Çñ) = |B|(Œ∂‚Çñ) ‚àí 1/Œª = 0
    Interpolate smooth periodic components of integrand with FFTs.
      G : œÅ, Œ±, Œ∂ ‚Ü¶ g‚Çò‚Çô(œÅ) exp(j [m Œ∏(œÅ,Œ±,Œ∂) + n Œ∂])
    Perform Gaussian quadrature after removing singularities.
      F·µ¢ : œÅ, Œ±, Œª, Œ∂‚ÇÅ, Œ∂‚ÇÇ ‚Ü¶  ‚à´·µ¢ f(œÅ,Œ±,Œª,Œ∂,{G‚±º}) dŒ∂

    If the map G is multivalued at a physical location, then it is still
    permissible if separable into periodic and secular components.
    In that case, supply the periodic component, which will be interpolated
    with FFTs, and use the provided coordinates Œ∏,Œ∂ ‚àà ‚Ñù to compose G.

    Comparison to Bounce1D
    ----------------------
    ``Bounce2D`` solves the dominant cost of optimization objectives relying on
    ``Bounce1D``: interpolating DESC's 3D transforms to an optimization-step
    dependent grid that is dense enough for function approximation with local
    splines. This is sometimes referred to as off-grid interpolation in literature;
    it is often a bottleneck.

    * The function approximation done here requires DESC transforms on a fixed
      grid with typical resolution, using FFTs to compute the map between
      coordinate systems. This enables evaluating functions along field lines
      without root-finding.
    * The faster convergence of spectral methods requires a less dense
      grid to interpolate onto from DESC's 3D transforms.
    * 2D interpolation enables tracing the field line for many toroidal transits.
    * The drawback is that evaluating a Fourier series with resolution F at Q
      non-uniform quadrature points takes ùí™([F+Q] log[F] log[1/Œµ]) time
      whereas cubic splines take ùí™(C Q) time. However, as NFP increases,
      F decreases whereas C increases. Also, Q >> F and Q >> C.

    # Notes
    # -----
    # For applications which reduce to computing a nonlinear function of distance
    # along field lines between bounce points, it is required to identify these
    # points with field-line-following coordinates. (In the special case of a linear
    # function summing integrals between bounce points over a flux surface, arbitrary
    # coordinate systems may be used as that task reduces to a surface integral,
    # which is invariant to the order of summation).
    #
    # The DESC coordinate system is related to field-line-following coordinate
    # systems by a relation whose solution is best found with Newton iteration
    # since this solution is unique. Newton iteration is not a globally
    # convergent algorithm to find the real roots of r : Œ∂ ‚Ü¶ |B|(Œ∂) ‚àí 1/Œª where
    # Œ∂ is a field-line-following coordinate. For this, function approximation
    # of |B| is necessary.
    #
    # Therefore, to compute bounce points {(Œ∂‚ÇÅ, Œ∂‚ÇÇ)}, we approximate |B| by a
    # series expansion of basis functions parameterized by a single variable Œ∂,
    # restricting the class of basis functions to low order (e.g. n = 2·µè where
    # k is small) algebraic or trigonometric polynomial with integer frequencies.
    # These are the two classes useful for function approximation and for which
    # there exists globally convergent root-finding algorithms. We require low
    # order because the computation expenses grow with the number of potential
    # roots, and the theorem of algebra states that number is n (2n) for algebraic
    # (trigonometric) polynomials of degree n.
    #
    # The frequency transform of a map under the chosen basis must be concentrated
    # at low frequencies for the series to converge fast. For periodic
    # (non-periodic) maps, the standard choice for the basis is a Fourier (Chebyshev)
    # series. Both converge exponentially, but the larger region of convergence in the
    # complex plane of Fourier series makes it preferable to choose coordinate
    # systems such that the function to approximate is periodic. One reason Chebyshev
    # polynomials are preferred to other orthogonal polynomial series is
    # fast discrete polynomial transforms (DPT) are implemented via fast transform
    # to Chebyshev then DCT. Therefore, a Fourier-Chebyshev series is chosen
    # to interpolate Œ∏(Œ±,Œ∂) and a piecewise Chebyshev series interpolates |B|(Œ∂).
    #
    # * An alternative to Chebyshev series is
    #   [filtered Fourier series](doi.org/10.1016/j.aml.2006.10.001).
    #   We did not implement or benchmark against that.
    # * Œ∏ is not interpolated with a double Fourier series Œ∏(œë, Œ∂) because
    #   it is impossible to approximate an unbounded function with a finite Fourier
    #   series. Due to Gibbs effects, this statement holds even when the goal is to
    #   approximate Œ∏ over one branch cut. The proof uses analytic continuation.
    # * The advantage of Fourier series in DESC coordinates is that they may use the
    #   spectrally condensed variable Œ∂* = NFP Œ∂. This cannot be done in any other
    #   coordinate system, regardless of whether the basis functions are periodic.
    #   The strategy of parameterizing |B| along field lines with a single variable
    #   in Clebsch coordinates (as opposed to two variables in straight-field line
    #   coordinates) also serves to minimize this penalty since evaluation of |B|
    #   when computing bounce points will be less expensive (assuming the 2D
    #   Fourier resolution of |B|(œë, œï) is larger than the 1D Chebyshev resolution).
    #
    # Computing accurate series expansions in (Œ±, Œ∂) coordinates demands
    # particular interpolation points in that coordinate system. Newton iteration
    # is used to compute Œ∏ at these points. Note that interpolation is necessary
    # because there is no transformation that converts series coefficients in
    # periodic coordinates, e.g. (œë, œï), to a low order polynomial basis in
    # non-periodic coordinates. For example, one can obtain series coefficients in
    # (Œ±, œï) coordinates from those in (œë, œï) as follows
    #   g : œë, œï ‚Ü¶ ‚àë‚Çò‚Çô a‚Çò‚Çô exp(j [mœë + nœï])
    #
    #   g : Œ±, œï ‚Ü¶ ‚àë‚Çò‚Çô a‚Çò‚Çô exp(j [mŒ± + (m Œπ + n)œï])
    # However, the basis for the latter are trigonometric functions with
    # irrational frequencies, courtesy of the irrational rotational transform.
    # Globally convergent root-finding schemes for that basis (at fixed Œ±) are
    # not known. The denominator of a close rational could be absorbed into the
    # coordinate œï, but this balloons the frequency, and hence the degree of the
    # series.
    #
    # After computing the bounce points, the supplied quadrature is performed.
    # By default, this is a Gauss quadrature after removing the singularity.
    # Fast fourier transforms interpolate smooth functions in the integrand to the
    # quadrature nodes. Quadrature is chosen over Runge-Kutta methods of the form
    #     ‚àÇF·µ¢/‚àÇŒ∂ = f(œÅ,Œ±,Œª,Œ∂,{G‚±º}) subject to F·µ¢(Œ∂‚ÇÅ) = 0
    # A fourth order Runge-Kutta method is equivalent to a quadrature
    # with Simpson's rule. The quadratures resolve these integrals more efficiently.
    #
    # Fast transforms are used where possible. Fast multipoint methods are not
    # implemented. For non-uniform interpolation, MMTs are used. It will be
    # worthwhile to use the inverse non-uniform fast transforms.

            (Œ∏, Œ∂) ‚àà [0, 2œÄ) √ó [0, 2œÄ/NFP). The Œ∂ coordinates (the unique values prior
            to taking the tensor-product) must be strictly increasing.
            Below shape notation defines ``M=grid.num_theta`` and ``N=grid.num_zeta``.

            Data evaluated on ``grid``.
            Must include names in ``Bounce2D.required_names``.
        theta : jnp.ndarray
            Shape (num rho, X, Y).
            DESC coordinates Œ∏ sourced from the Clebsch coordinates
            ``FourierChebyshevSeries.nodes(X,Y,rho,domain=(0,2*jnp.pi))``.
            Use the ``Bounce2D.compute_theta`` method to obtain this.
        Y_B : int
            Desired resolution for |B| along field lines to compute bounce points.
            Default is double ``Y``.
        alpha : float
            Starting field line poloidal label.
        num_transit : int
            Number of toroidal transits to follow field line.
        quad : tuple[jnp.ndarray]
            Quadrature points x‚Çñ and weights w‚Çñ for the approximate evaluation of an
            integral ‚à´‚Çã‚ÇÅ¬π g(x) dx = ‚àë‚Çñ w‚Çñ g(x‚Çñ). Default is 32 points.
        automorphism : tuple[Callable] or None
            The first callable should be an automorphism of the real interval [-1, 1].
            The second callable should be the derivative of the first. This map defines
            a change of variable for the bounce integral. The choice made for the
            automorphism will affect the performance of the quadrature method.
        Bref : float

        Lref : float
            Optional. Reference length scale for normalization.

            Whether the arrays in ``data`` are already reshaped to the expected form of
            shape (..., M, N) or (num rho, M, N). This option can be used to iteratively
            compute bounce integrals one flux surface at a time, reducing memory usage
            To do so, set to true and provide only those axes of the reshaped data.
            Default is false.
        is_fourier : bool
            If true, then it is assumed that ``data`` holds Fourier transforms
            as returned by ``Bounce2D.fourier``. Default is false.
        check : bool
            Flag for debugging. Must be false for JAX transformations.
        spline : bool
            Whether to use cubic splines to compute bounce points.
            Default is true, because the algorithm for efficient root-finding on
            Chebyshev series algorithm is not yet implemented.

            pitch and field line. Default is ``None``, which will detect all wells,
            but due to current limitations in JAX this will have worse performance.
            Specifying a number that tightly upper bounds the number of wells will
            increase performance. In general, an upper bound on the number of wells
            per toroidal transit is ``AŒπ+B`` where ``A``,``B`` are the poloidal and
            toroidal Fourier resolution of |B|, respectively, in straight-field line
            PEST coordinates, and Œπ is the rotational transform normalized by 2œÄ.
            A tighter upper bound than ``num_well=(AŒπ+B)*num_transit`` is preferable.
            The ``check_points`` or ``plot`` method is useful to select a reasonable
            value.

            If there were fewer wells detected along a field line than the size of the
            last axis of the returned arrays, then that axis is padded with zero.

            line and pitch, is padded with zero.

class Bounce1D(Bounce):
    """Computes bounce integrals using one-dimensional local spline methods.

    The bounce integral is defined as ‚à´ f(œÅ,Œ±,Œª,‚Ñì) d‚Ñì where

    * d‚Ñì parameterizes the distance along the field line in meters.
    * f(œÅ,Œ±,Œª,‚Ñì) is the quantity to integrate along the field line.
    * The boundaries of the integral are bounce points ‚Ñì‚ÇÅ, ‚Ñì‚ÇÇ s.t. Œª|B|(œÅ,Œ±,‚Ñì·µ¢) = 1.
    * Œª is a constant defining the integral proportional to the magnetic moment
      over energy.
    * |B| is the norm of the magnetic field.

    For a particle with fixed Œª, bounce points are defined to be the location on the
    field line such that the particle's velocity parallel to the magnetic field is zero.
    The bounce integral is defined up to a sign. We choose the sign that corresponds to
    the particle's guiding center trajectory traveling in the direction of increasing
    field-line-following coordinate Œ∂.

    Notes
    -----
    The function approximation in ``Bounce1D`` is ignorant that the objects to
    approximate are defined on a bounded subset of ‚Ñù¬≤. Instead, the domain is
    projected to ‚Ñù, where information sampled about the function at infinity
    cannot support reconstruction of the function near the origin. As the
    functions of interest do not vanish at infinity, pseudo-spectral techniques
    are not used. Instead, function approximation is done with local splines.
    This is useful if one can efficiently obtain data along field lines and the
    number of toroidal transits to follow a field line is not large.

    After computing the bounce points, the supplied quadrature is performed.
    By default, this is a Gauss quadrature after removing the singularity.
    Local splines interpolate smooth functions in the integrand to the quadrature
    nodes. Quadrature is chosen over Runge-Kutta methods of the form
        ‚àÇF·µ¢/‚àÇŒ∂ = f(Œª,Œ∂,{G‚±º}) subject to F·µ¢(Œ∂‚ÇÅ) = 0
    A fourth order Runge-Kutta method is equivalent to a quadrature
    with Simpson's rule. The quadratures resolve these integrals more efficiently.

        points : tuple[jnp.ndarray]
            Shape (num alpha, num rho, num pitch, num well).
            Optional, output of method ``self.points``.
            Tuple of length two (z1, z2) that stores Œ∂ coordinates of bounce points.
            The points are ordered and grouped such that the straight line path
            between ``z1`` and ``z2`` resides in the epigraph of |B|.
        method : str
            Method of interpolation.
            See https://interpax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_api/interpax.interp1d.html.
            Default is cubic C1 local spline.
