Adding new objective functions
------------------------------

This guide walks through creating a new objective to optimize using Quasi-symmetry as
an example. The primary methods needed for a new objective are ``__init__``, ``build``,
and ``compute``. The base class ``_Objective`` provides a number of other methods that
generally do not need to be re-implemented for subclasses.

``__init__`` should generally just assign attributes and store inputs. It should not do
any expensive calculations, these should be in ``build`` or ``compute``. The main arguments
are summarized in the example below.

``build`` is called before optimization with the ``Equilibrium`` to be optimized.
It is used to precompute things like transform matrices that convert between spectral
coefficients and real space values.
In the build method, we first ensure that a ``Grid`` is assigned, using default values
from the equilibrium if necessary. The grid defines the points in flux coordinates where
we evaluate the residuals.
Next, we define the physics quantities we need to evaluate the objective (``_data_keys``),
and the number of residuals that will be returned by ``compute`` (``_dim_f``).
Next, we use some helper functions to build the required ``Tranform`` and ``Profile``
objects needed to compute the desired physics quantities. These ``transforms`` and
``profiles`` are then packaged into ``constants``, which will be passed to the ``compute``
method. Other "constant" values that are needed to compute the given quantity such as
hyperparameters or other objects that will not be optimized should also be included in
``constants``.
Finally, we call the base class ``build`` method to do some checking of array sizes and
other misc. stuff.

``compute`` is where the actual calculation of the residual takes place. Objectives
generally return a vector of residuals that are minimized in a least squares sense, though
the exact method will depend on the optimization algorithm. The main thing here is
calling ``compute_fun`` to get physics quantities, and then performing any post-processing
we want such as averaging, combining, etc.

A full example objective with comments describing key points is given below:

            Equilibrium that will be optimized to satisfy the Objective.
        target : float, ndarray, optional
            Target value(s) of the objective. Only used if bounds is None.
            len(target) must be equal to Objective.dim_f
        bounds : tuple, optional
            Lower and upper bounds on the objective. Overrides target.

            Whether to compute the error in physical units or non-dimensionalize.
        normalize_target : bool
            Whether target should be normalized before comparing to computed values.
            if `normalize` is `True` and the target is in physical units, this should also
            be set to True.
        grid : Grid, ndarray, optional
            Collocation grid containing the nodes to evaluate at.
        name : str
