"""
Functions for taking the curl and divergence in cylindrical coordinates.

Partial derivatives are calculated using spectral methods. Both functions
have an identical API that requires as inputs the input and output Transform
objects to and from spectral space, assumed to be for the same basis.

    """Take the curl of A in cylindrical coordinates.

    Uses spectral methods to take partial derivatives of A and calculate
    its curl on the grid associated with out_transform.

    Parameters
    ----------
    A : ndarray, shape(n,3)
        vector field, in cylindrical (R,phi,Z) form
    in_R : ndarray, shape(n,)
        radial distance for each point of A
    out_R : ndarray, shape(n,)
        radial location for each point at which to calculate
        the curl
    in_transform: Transform
        transform from the real grid on which A is defined to
        a spectral basis in which partial derivatives of A can be evaluated.
        the pseudoinverse of the transform must have been built.
    out_transform: Transform
        transform from the spectral basis on which A is calculated to the
        real grid on which the curl is to be evaluated.
        the transform must have been built, with derivs>=1.
    scales: jnp.ndarray, shape (3,)
        This parameter adjusts the dimensions of the partial derivatives so they are
        taken with respect to the normal coordinates, not the coordinates in the
        transform.

    -------

        The curl of the vector field, in cylindrical coordinates.
