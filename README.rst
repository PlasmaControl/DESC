Stellarator Equilibrium Solver

|License| |Docs| |Travis| |Codecov|

DESC computes 3D MHD equilibria by solving the force balance equations.
It can also be used for perturbation analysis and sensitivity studies to see how the equilibria change as input parameters are varied.

The theoretical approach and numerical methods used by DESC are presented in this paper_ [1]_ 
and documented at Theory_. 
Please cite our work if you use DESC!

Quick Start
===========

.. role:: bash(code)
   :language: bash

For instructions on installing DESC and its dependencies, see Installation_. 
The code is run using the syntax :bash:`python -m desc <path/to/input_file>` and the full list of command line options are given in `Command Line Interface`_. 
DESC requires an input file to specify the equilibrium and solver options, and can also accept VMEC input files.
Refer to Inputs_ for documentation on how to format the input file.
The equilibrium solution is output in both an ASCII text file and a HDF5 binary file, whose formats are detailed in Outputs_.
