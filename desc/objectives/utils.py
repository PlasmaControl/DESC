def factorize_linear_constraints(objective, constraint, x_scale="auto"):  # noqa: C901
    """Compute and factorize A to get pseudoinverse and nullspace.

    Given constraints of the form Ax=b, factorize A to find a particular solution xp
    and the null space Z st. Axp=b and AZ=0, so that the full space of solutions to
    Ax=b can be written as x=xp + Zy where y is now unconstrained.

    Parameters
    ----------
    objective : ObjectiveFunction
        Objective function to optimize.
    constraint : ObjectiveFunction
        Objective function of linear constraints to enforce.
    x_scale : array_like or ``'auto'``, optional
        Characteristic scale of each variable. Setting ``x_scale`` is equivalent
        to reformulating the problem in scaled variables ``xs = x / x_scale``.
        If set to ``'auto'``, the scale is determined from the initial state vector.

    Returns
    -------
    xp : ndarray
        Particular solution to Ax=b.
    A : ndarray ndarray
        Combined constraint matrix, such that A @ x[unfixed_idx] == b.
    b : list of ndarray
        Combined RHS vector.
    Z : ndarray
        Null space operator for full combined A such that A @ Z == 0.
    D : ndarray
        Scale of the full state vector x, as set by the parameter ``x_scale``.
    unfixed_idx : ndarray
        Indices of x that correspond to non-fixed values.
    project, recover : function
        Functions to project full vector x into reduced vector y,
        and to recover x from y.
