DESC solves for and optimizes 3D MHD equilibria using pseudo-spectral numerical methods
and automatic differentiation.

The theoretical approach and implementation details used by DESC are presented in the
following papers and documented at Theory_. Please cite our work if you use DESC!

Quick Start
===========

The easiest way to install DESC is from PyPI: ``pip install desc-opt``

For more detailed instructions on installing DESC and its dependencies, see Installation_.

The best place to start learning about DESC is our tutorials:

- `Basic fixed boundary equilibrium`_: running from a VMEC input, creating an equilibrium from scratch
- `Advanced equilibrium`_: continuation and perturbation methods.
- `Free boundary equilibrium`_: vacuum and or finite beta with external field.
- `Using DESC outputs`_: analysis, plotting, saving to VMEC format.
- `Basic optimization`_: specifying objectives, fixing degrees of freedom.
- `Advanced optimization`_: advanced constraints, precise quasi-symmetry, constrained optimization.
- `Near axis constraints`_: loading solutions from QSC/QIC and fixing near axis expansion.

For details on the various objectives, constraints, optimizable objects and more, see
the full `api documentation`_.

If all you need is an equilibrium solution, the simplest method is through the command
line by giving an input file specifying the equilibrium and solver options, this
way can also can also accept VMEC input files.

The code is run using the syntax ``desc <path/to/inputfile>`` and the full list
of command line options are given in `Command Line Interface`_. (Note that you may have
to prepend the command with ``python -m``)

Refer to `Inputs`_ for documentation on how to format the input file.

The equilibrium solution is output in a HDF5 binary file, whose format is detailed in `Outputs`_.
