    Examples

    See ``tests/test_integrals.py::TestBounce2D::test_bounce2d_checks``.

    See Also
    --------
    Bounce1D
        ``Bounce1D`` uses one-dimensional splines for the same task.
        ``Bounce2D`` solves the dominant cost of optimization objectives in DESC
        relying on ``Bounce1D``: interpolating FourierZernike transforms to an
        optimization-step dependent grid that is dense enough for function
        approximation with local splines.
        The function approximation done here requires FourierZernike transforms on a
        fixed grid with typical resolution, using FFTs to compute the map between
        coordinate systems.
        The faster convergence of spectral methods requires a less dense
        grid to interpolate onto from FourierZernike transforms.
        2D interpolation enables tracing the field line for many toroidal transits.
        The drawback is that evaluating a Fourier series with resolution F at Q
        non-uniform quadrature points takes ùí™(-(F+Q) log(F) log(Œµ)) time
        whereas cubic splines take ùí™(C Q) time. However, as NFP increases,
        F decreases whereas C increases. Also, Q >> F and Q >> C.

    Parameters
    ----------
    grid : Grid
        Tensor-product grid in (œÅ, Œ∏, Œ∂) with uniformly spaced nodes
        (Œ∏, Œ∂) ‚àà [0, 2œÄ) √ó [0, 2œÄ/NFP). The Œ∂ coordinates (the unique values prior
        to taking the tensor-product) must be strictly increasing.
        Below shape notation defines ``M=grid.num_theta`` and ``N=grid.num_zeta``.
        ``M`` and ``N`` are preferably rounded down to powers of two.
    data : dict[str, jnp.ndarray]
        Data evaluated on ``grid``.
        Must include names in ``Bounce2D.required_names``.
    theta : jnp.ndarray
        Shape (num rho, X, Y).
        DESC coordinates Œ∏ sourced from the Clebsch coordinates
        ``FourierChebyshevSeries.nodes(X,Y,rho,domain=(0,2*jnp.pi))``.
        Use the ``Bounce2D.compute_theta`` method to obtain this.
        ``X`` and ``Y`` are preferably rounded down to powers of two.
    Y_B : int
        Desired resolution for algorithm to compute bounce points.
        Default is double ``Y``.
    alpha : jnp.ndarray
        Shape (num alpha, ).
        Starting field line poloidal labels.
        Default is single field line. To compute a surface average
        on a rational surface, it is necessary to average over multiple
        field lines until the surface is covered sufficiently.
    num_transit : int
        Number of toroidal transits to follow field line.
        In an axisymmetric device, field line integration over a single poloidal
        transit is sufficient to capture a surface average. For a 3D
        configuration, more transits will approximate surface averages on an
        irrational magnetic surface better, with diminishing returns.
    quad : tuple[jnp.ndarray]
        Quadrature points x‚Çñ and weights w‚Çñ for the approximate evaluation of an
        integral ‚à´‚Çã‚ÇÅ¬π g(x) dx = ‚àë‚Çñ w‚Çñ g(x‚Çñ). Default is 32 points.
    automorphism : tuple[Callable] or None
        The first callable should be an automorphism of the real interval [-1, 1].
        The second callable should be the derivative of the first. This map defines
        a change of variable for the bounce integral. The choice made for the
        automorphism will affect the performance of the quadrature.
    Bref : float
        Optional. Reference magnetic field strength for normalization.
    Lref : float
        Optional. Reference length scale for normalization.
    is_reshaped : bool
        Whether the arrays in ``data`` are already reshaped to the expected form of
        shape (..., M, N) or (num rho, M, N). This option can be used to iteratively
        compute bounce integrals one flux surface at a time, reducing memory usage
        To do so, set to true and provide only those axes of the reshaped data.
        Default is false.
    is_fourier : bool
        If true, then it is assumed that ``data`` holds Fourier transforms
        as returned by ``Bounce2D.fourier``. Default is false.
    check : bool
        Flag for debugging. Must be false for JAX transformations.
    spline : bool
        Whether to use cubic splines to compute bounce points.
        Default is true, because the algorithm for efficient root-finding on
        Chebyshev series is not yet implemented.

    """

    # For applications which reduce to computing a nonlinear function of distance
    # along field lines between bounce points, it is required to identify these
    # points with field-line-following coordinates. (In the special case of a linear
    # function summing integrals between bounce points over a flux surface, arbitrary
    # coordinate systems may be used as that task reduces to a surface integral,
    # which is invariant to the order of summation).
    #
    # The DESC coordinate system is related to field-line-following coordinate
    # systems by a relation whose solution is best found with Newton iteration
    # since this solution is unique. Newton iteration is not a globally
    # convergent algorithm to find the real roots of r : Œ∂ ‚Ü¶ B(Œ∂) ‚àí 1/Œª where
    # Œ∂ is a field-line-following coordinate. For this, function approximation
    # of B is necessary.
    #
    # The frequency transform of a map under the chosen basis must be concentrated
    # at low frequencies for the series to converge fast. For periodic
    # (non-periodic) maps, the standard choice for the basis is a Fourier (Chebyshev)
    # series. Both converge exponentially, but the larger region of convergence in the
    # complex plane of Fourier series makes it preferable to choose coordinate
    # systems such that the function to approximate is periodic. One reason Chebyshev
    # polynomials are preferred to other orthogonal polynomial series is
    # fast discrete polynomial transforms (DPT) are implemented via fast transform
    # to Chebyshev then DCT. Therefore, a Fourier-Chebyshev series is chosen
    # to interpolate Œ∏(Œ±,Œ∂). An alternative to Chebyshev series is a
    # [filtered Fourier series](doi.org/10.1016/j.aml.2006.10.001)
    # or the more recent Fourier continuation methods.
    # We did not benchmark that.
    #
    # Function approximation in (Œ±, Œ∂) coordinates demands particular interpolation
    # points in that coordinate system because there is no transformation that converts
    # series coefficients in periodic coordinates, e.g. (œë, œï), to a low order
    # polynomial basis in non-periodic coordinates. For example, one can obtain series
    # coefficients in (Œ±, œï) coordinates from those in (œë, œï) as follows
    #   g : œë, œï ‚Ü¶ ‚àë‚Çò‚Çô a‚Çò‚Çô exp(j [mœë + nœï])
    #
    #   g : Œ±, œï ‚Ü¶ ‚àë‚Çò‚Çô a‚Çò‚Çô exp(j [mŒ± + (m Œπ + n)œï])
    # However, the basis for the latter are trigonometric functions with
    # irrational frequencies, courtesy of the irrational rotational transform.
    # Globally convergent root-finding schemes for that basis (at fixed Œ±) are
    # not known. The denominator of a close rational could be absorbed into the
    # coordinate œï, but this balloons the frequency, and hence degree of the series.
    #
    # Quadrature is chosen over Runge-Kutta methods of the form
    #     ‚àÇF·µ¢/‚àÇŒ∂ = f(œÅ,Œ±,Œª,Œ∂,{G‚±º}) subject to F·µ¢(Œ∂‚ÇÅ) = 0
    # A fourth order Runge-Kutta method is equivalent to a quadrature
    # with Simpson's rule. The quadratures resolve these integrals more efficiently.

            but due to current limitations in JAX this will have worse performance.
            Specifying a number that tightly upper bounds the number of wells will
            increase performance. In general, an upper bound on the number of wells
            per toroidal transit is ``AŒπ+B`` where ``A``, ``B`` are the poloidal and
            toroidal Fourier resolution of B, respectively, in straight-field line
            PEST coordinates, and Œπ is the rotational transform normalized by 2œÄ.
            A tighter upper bound than ``num_well=(AŒπ+B)*num_transit`` is preferable.
            The ``check_points`` or ``plot`` method is useful to select a reasonable
            value.

            If there were fewer wells detected along a field line than the size of the
            last axis of the returned arrays, then that axis is padded with zero.

            line and pitch, is padded with zero.

    """Computes bounce integrals using one-dimensional local spline methods.

    The bounce integral is defined as ‚à´ f(œÅ,Œ±,Œª,‚Ñì) d‚Ñì where

    * d‚Ñì parameterizes the distance along the field line in meters.
    * f(œÅ,Œ±,Œª,‚Ñì) is the quantity to integrate along the field line.
    * The boundaries of the integral are bounce points ‚Ñì‚ÇÅ, ‚Ñì‚ÇÇ s.t. ŒªB(œÅ,Œ±,‚Ñì·µ¢) = 1.
    * Œª is a constant defining the integral proportional to the magnetic moment
      over energy.
    * B is the norm of the magnetic field.

    For a particle with fixed Œª, bounce points are defined to be the location on the
    field line such that the particle's velocity parallel to the magnetic field is zero.
    The bounce integral is defined up to a sign. We choose the sign that corresponds to
    the particle's guiding center trajectory traveling in the direction of increasing
    field-line-following coordinate Œ∂.

    Bounce2D
        ``Bounce2D`` uses 2D pseudo-spectral methods for the same task.
        The function approximation in ``Bounce1D`` is ignorant
        that the objects to approximate are defined on a bounded subset of ‚Ñù¬≤.
        The domain is projected to ‚Ñù, where information sampled about the function
        at infinity cannot support reconstruction of the function near the origin.
        As the functions of interest do not vanish at infinity, pseudo-spectral
        techniques are not used. Instead, function approximation is done with local
        splines. This is useful if one can efficiently obtain data along field lines
        and the number of toroidal transits to follow a field line is not large.

    Parameters
    ----------
    grid : Grid
        Tensor-product grid in (œÅ, Œ±, Œ∂) Clebsch coordinates.
        The Œ∂ coordinates (the unique values prior to taking the tensor-product)
        must be strictly increasing and preferably uniformly spaced. These are used
        as knots to construct splines. A reference knot density is 100 knots per
        toroidal transit.
    data : dict[str, jnp.ndarray]
        Data evaluated on ``grid``.
        Must include names in ``Bounce1D.required_names``.
    quad : tuple[jnp.ndarray]
        Quadrature points x‚Çñ and weights w‚Çñ for the approximate evaluation of an
        integral ‚à´‚Çã‚ÇÅ¬π g(x) dx = ‚àë‚Çñ w‚Çñ g(x‚Çñ). Default is 32 points.
    automorphism : tuple[Callable] or None
        The first callable should be an automorphism of the real interval [-1, 1].
        The second callable should be the derivative of the first. This map defines
        a change of variable for the bounce integral. The choice made for the
        automorphism will affect the performance of the quadrature.
    Bref : float
        Optional. Reference magnetic field strength for normalization.
    Lref : float
        Optional. Reference length scale for normalization.
    is_reshaped : bool
        Whether the arrays in ``data`` are already reshaped to the expected form of
        shape (..., num zeta) or (..., num alpha, num zeta) or
        (num rho, num alpha, num zeta). This option can be used to iteratively
        compute bounce integrals one flux surface or one field line at a time,
        respectively, reducing memory usage. To do so, set to true and provide
        only those axes of the reshaped data. Default is false.
    check : bool
        Flag for debugging. Must be false for JAX transformations.

        Parameters
        ----------
        f : jnp.ndarray
            Shape (num rho, num alpha, num zeta).
            Real scalar-valued functions evaluated on the ``grid`` supplied to
            construct this object. Use the method ``Bounce1D.reshape`` to
            reshape the data into the expected shape.
        points : tuple[jnp.ndarray]
            Shape (num rho, num alpha, num pitch, num well).
            Optional, output of method ``self.points``.
            Tuple of length two (z1, z2) that stores Œ∂ coordinates of bounce points.
            The points are ordered and grouped such that the straight line path
            between ``z1`` and ``z2`` resides in the epigraph of B.
        method : str
            Method of interpolation.
            See https://interpax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_api/interpax.interp1d.html.
            Default is cubic C1 local spline.
