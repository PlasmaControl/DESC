# notes on versioning:
# "major" packages like sphinx, flake8, pytest etc are pinned to a compatible major
# version, eg ~8.0 includes 8.0.0, 8.0.2 etc. We assume these are more careful
# with their versioning since they are primary infrastructure for lots of stuff
# "minor" packages (all the other ones) are pinned to a maximum specific version
# which will need to be updated regularly, but we don't want to do so without testing.
