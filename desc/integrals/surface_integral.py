    As an example, by specifying the combination of ``line_label="poloidal"`` and

    for each zeta surface in the grid.

    Notes
    -----
        It is assumed that the integration curve has length 1 when the line
        label is rho and length 2π when the line label is theta or zeta.

        nodes and is one of the predefined grid types

    line_label : str
        The coordinate curve to compute the integration over.
        To clarify, a theta (poloidal) curve is the intersection of a
        rho surface (flux surface) and zeta (toroidal) surface.
    fix_surface : (str, float)
        A tuple of the form: label, value.

    The returned method takes an array input ``q`` and returns an array output.

    Given a set of kernel functions in ``q``, each parameterized by at most
    five variables, the returned method computes an integral transform,
    reducing ``q`` to a set of functions of at most three variables.

    -------

        Method to compute any surface integral transform of the input ``q`` over
        each surface in the grid with code: ``function(q)``.

        The first dimension of ``q`` should always discretize some function, g,

        Input
        -----
        If ``q`` has one dimension, then it should have shape
        (``grid.num_nodes``, ).
        If ``q`` has multiple dimensions, then it should have shape
        (``grid.num_nodes``, *f.shape).

        ------
        Each element along the first dimension of the returned array, stores
        Tᵤ₁ for a particular surface of constant u₁ in the given grid.
        The order is sorted in increasing order of the values which specify u₁.

        (grid.num_surface_label, ).
        If ``q`` has multiple dimensions, the returned array has shape
        (grid.num_surface_label, *f.shape).

    Notes
    -----
        There are three different methods to unbias the variance of a weighted
        sample so that the computed variance better estimates the true variance.
        Whether the method is correct for a particular use case depends on what
        the weights assigned to each sample represent.

        This function implements the first case, where the weights are not random
        and are intended to assign more weight to some samples for reasons
        unrelated to differences in uncertainty between samples. See
        https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weighted_arithmetic_mean#Reliability_weights.

        The second case is when the weights are intended to assign more weight
        to samples with less uncertainty. See
        https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverse-variance_weighting.
        The unbiased sample variance for this case is obtained by replacing the
        effective number of samples in the formula this function implements,
        nₑ, with the actual number of samples n.

        The third case is when the weights denote the integer frequency of each
        sample. See
        https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weighted_arithmetic_mean#Frequency_weights.
        This is indeed a distinct case from the above two because here the
        weights encode additional information about the distribution.

    Parameters
    ----------
    grid : Grid
        Collocation grid containing the nodes to evaluate at.
    q : ndarray
        Quantity to compute the sample variance.
    weights : ndarray
        Weight assigned to each sample of ``q``.
        A good candidate for this parameter is the surface area Jacobian.
    bias : bool
        If this condition is true, then the biased estimator of the sample
        variance is returned. This is desirable if you are only concerned with
        computing the variance of the given set of numbers and not the
        distribution the numbers are (potentially) sampled from.
    surface_label : str
        The surface label of rho, poloidal, or zeta to compute the variance over.
    expand_out : bool
        Whether to expand the output array so that the output has the same
        shape as the input. Defaults to true so that the output may be
        broadcast in the same way as the input. Setting to false will save
        memory.
    tol : float
        Tolerance for considering nodes the same.
        Only relevant if the grid object doesn't already have this information.

    Returns
    -------
    variance : ndarray
        Variance of the given weighted sample over each surface in the grid.
        By default, the returned array has the same shape as the input.
