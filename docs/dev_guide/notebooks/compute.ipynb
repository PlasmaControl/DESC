    "In DESC, quantities of interest (such as force error `F`, magnetic field strength `|B|` and its vector components)   are computed from `Equilibrium` objects through the use of `compute_XXX` functions. The `Equilibrium` object has a `eq.compute(name=\"NAME OF QUANTITY TO COMPUTE\",grid=Grid)` method which takes in the string `name` of the quantity to compute from the `Equilibrium`, and a `Grid` of coordinates $(\\rho,\\theta,\\zeta)$ to evaluate the quantity at. This method then uses the `name` to find which `compute_XXX` function is needed to call in order to calculate that quantity.\n",
    "\n",
    "These `compute_XXX` functions live inside of the `desc/compute` folder, and inside that folder the `data_index.py` file contains the list of all available quantities that `name` could specify to be computed, as well as information on that quantity and which `compute_XXX` function should be called in order to compute it.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `compute_XXX` functions have function signatures that take in as arguments the necessary variables from `{R_lmn, Z_lmn, L_lmn, i_l, c_l, p_l,Psi}` required to calculate the quantity contained in a dict argument named `params`, as well as the `Transform` objects (in the `transforms` dict argument) and/or `Profile` objects (in the `profiles` dict argument) needed to evaluate those variables in `params` (which are spectral coefficients, except for `Psi`) at the points in real space specified by the desired `Grid` object (which is contained in the `Transform` objects passed).\n",

Note that only one of `i_l,c_l` are needed, and if both are passed the rotational transform `i_l` will be used.\n",

    " - `data` argument is an optional dictionary. The compute functions store the quantities they calculate in a `data` dictionary and return it, and if `data` is passed in, the quantities this function computes will be added to this dictionary.

    "### Scalar Algebra\n",
    "Storing the quantities in arrays like this enables for easy computation using these quantities. For example, if one wants to calculate the magnitude of the pressure gradient $|\\nabla p(\\rho)| = \\sqrt{p'(\\rho)^2}|\\nabla\\rho|$, one simply [writes out the expression](https://github.com/PlasmaControl/DESC/blob/6d03cb015701b27d651bf804d36032c35119c536/desc/compute/_equil.py#L114) after calling the necessary compute functions:\n",

As an example, if calculating the contravariant radial basis vector $\\mathbf{e}^{\\rho} = \\frac{\\mathbf{e}^{\\theta} \\times \\mathbf{e}^{\\zeta}}{\\sqrt{g}}$, one [writes](https://github.com/PlasmaControl/DESC/blob/6d03cb015701b27d651bf804d36032c35119c536/desc/compute/_core.py#L426):\n",

    "The desired operation here is to multiply `data[\"psi_r\"]`, which is a scalar quantity at each grid point and so is of shape `(num_nodes,)` with `data[\"e^rho\"]`, a vector quantity and so is of shape `(num_nodes,3)`. \n",
    "We want the result to be of shape `(num_nodes,3)`. \n",
    "In order to do so, we first must transpose the vector quantity to be shape `(3,num_nodes)`, so that when multiplied together with the scalar quantity of shape `(num_nodes,3)`, the result is broadcast to an array of shape `(3,num_nodes)`. \n",
    "If the transpose did not occur, the two shapes `(num_nodes,)` and `(num_nodes,3)` would be incompatible with eachother.\n",
    "The second transpose after the multiplication is to ensure that the result is in the shape `(num_nodes,3)`, as is the convention expected in the code."
